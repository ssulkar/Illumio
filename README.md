TESTING:
Most of my testing was on the cli which required me to manually run through it.
I made the cli as streamlined as possible to handle unpredictable inputs.
I surrounded several blocks of code with try/excepts.

INTERESTING NOTES:
I created a class called QueryTester that had a static method called validate url.
This useful method can be used without instantiating the class itself.

REFINITEMENTS:
I would've added a check to prevent users from adding duplicate urls since it is a waste of memory.

HOW TO RUN:
Run the program by typing:
>> python Illumio
